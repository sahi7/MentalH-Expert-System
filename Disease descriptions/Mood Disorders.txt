Mood disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by significant changes in mood, which can interfere with daily activities and personal relationships. There are several types of mood disorders, including:

    Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): it involves persistent and intense feelings of sadness or loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable.

    Bipolar Disorder: involves episodes of depression and mania, which is characterized by elevated mood, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, and increased energy.

    Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD): involves chronic, low-grade depression that lasts for at least two years.

    Cyclothymic Disorder: involves persistent and fluctuating mood changes that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder.
