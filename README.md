# Medical-Expert-System-For-Mental-Health
An expert system for diagnosis and prescription of mental health disorders
that aims to provide the patients with medical advice and basic
knowledge on various diseases

## Brief Description
Using expert system shells for the development of **Expert systems**. These shells are empty Expert System knowledge bases, which have the structure and interface already written for us; all we need to do is to add the knowledge into the KB. Instead of writing an Expert System from scratch, for this problem we will be using a small Expert System shell to design and implement an expert system. I used **Experta Framework** for building the concerned expert system.

## Idea
Many rural areas around the world have extremely limited access to medical advice. People travel long distances to clinics, or medical facilities and there is a shortage of medical experts in most of these facilities. This results in slow service, and patients end up waiting long hours without receiving any attention. Hence, medical expert systems can play a significant role in such cases where medical experts are not readily available. A Diagnosis Expert System can help a great deal in identifying those diseases and describing methods of treatment to be carried out. It tackles the following disorders;

- `Anxiety Disorders`
- `Mood Disorders`
- `Personality Disorders`
- `Schizophrenia`
- `Substance Use Disorders`
